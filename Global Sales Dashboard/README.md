# 📊 GlobalMart Sales Dashboard — Power BI Case Study

An interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing 4 years of sales data from GlobalMart, a fictional international retail company. The goal was to uncover key revenue trends, identify loss-making products, and help business leaders make smarter data-driven decisions.

## 🧩 Project Overview

This dashboard visualizes and explores sales data across regions, categories, and products to answer critical business questions such as:

- Which regions are performing best in terms of revenue and profit?
- Which sub-categories are draining profitability?
- What products are underperforming despite decent sales or volume?
- How does performance trend over time?

---

## 🛠 Tools & Techniques Used

- **Power BI Desktop** (Data Modeling, DAX, Visuals)
- **Power Query** (Data cleaning & transformation)
- **DAX Measures** (`Total Sales`, `Profit`, `Average Discount`, etc.)
- **Data Visualization Best Practices** (KPI layout, conditional formatting)

---

## 📊 Key Features & Visuals

- **KPI Cards** – Total Sales, Profit, Orders, Avg. Discount  
- **Interactive Slicer** – Filter dashboard by Region

---

## 🔍 Business Insights Discovered

- **South region** shows strong revenue but weak profitability — likely due to high discounting or margin pressure  
- **Tables**, **Bookcases**, and some **Fasteners** report consistent losses across multiple regions  
- Some products with high **quantity sold** still had very low **sales**, suggesting pricing inefficiencies  
- Clear seasonal spikes in **Q4 months**, hinting at holiday-driven sales opportunities

---

## 💡 Recommendations

- Reassess pricing or bundling strategies for loss-making product sub-categories  
- Review discounting policies in the South region  
- Discontinue or reposition products with persistent low demand  
- Capitalize on seasonal trends with planned promotions in high-sales periods
